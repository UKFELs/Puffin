Radiation is propagating in the negative $z$ direction (the vertical axis). One can see the noisy phase of the radiation in both transverse (x) and temporal (z) directions, which is due to the shot-noise of the electron beam. }}{2}}

The scaled $\mathaccentV {bar}016{z}_2$ coordinate is defined so that the front of the radiation and beam is to the left. This is the constant radiatioon frame, so the beam slips backwards through the field from left to right. In the lab frame, the beam and radiation propagates from right to left. The full length of the mesh must be large enough to contain the beam through propagation.}}{17}}
