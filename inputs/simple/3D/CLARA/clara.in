!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  CLARA input deck  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!
!!  233MeV beam,  lasing @ 100nm
!!  Lattice including drifts and quads is supplied
!!  The Twiss parameters in the beam field are matched
!!  to the quad channel
!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!
! The main input parameters are described below - Puffin takes the namelist blocks at the
! bottom of this file as input. This is the 'main' input file, containing info about the
! wiggler, field sampling, and general flags and other numerical instructions for the
! simulation. This file also points to a beam file, describing the electron beam,
! and optionally, a seed file (describing a radiation seed) and/or a lattice file.
