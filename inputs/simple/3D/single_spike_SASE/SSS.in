! The main input parameters are described below - Puffin takes the namelist blocks at the
! bottom of this file as input. This is the 'main' input file, containing info about the 
! wiggler, field sampling, and general flags and other numerical instructions for the
! simulation. This file also points to a beam file, seed file, and optionally a lattice 
! file.

!                      FLAGS
!
!
! qOneD                      If TRUE, model 1D FEL, with only 1 field node and 1 macroparticle in transverse dimensions
! qFieldEvolve               if letting the radiation field evolve
! qElectronsEvolve           if integrating electron equations
! qElectronFieldCoupling     if allowing field to feedback onto the electron equations
! qFocussing                 if focussing is included in the transverse plane
! qMatchedBeam               if matching beam to undulator. If TRUE, electron pulse sigma and length in x,y,px,py are automatically calculated
! qDiffraction               if modelling diffraction
! qFilter                    TRUE to filter, if FALSE the low frequencies will just be ignored during diffraction
! q_noise                    Shot noise in initial electron beam distribution
! qDump                      Do you wish to dump data so the run can be resumed if anything goes wrong? .TRUE. for yes.
! qResume                    If resuming from dump files left from a previous run
! qSeparateFiles             Each MPI process dumps its own local data, rather than doing a collective write.
